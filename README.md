Carving Spherical Cavities in Atomic Structures for Nanoparticle Integration
- Overview:
    NanoNest optimizes an atomic structure comprising water, oil, surfactant,
    salt, and counter ions. Upon optimization, nanoparticles will be accommodated
    by creating a designated space at the interface.
- Considerations:
    While preparing the system for nanoparticle addition, the following factors should
    be closely observed:
        Residue Management: The removal of water and oil residues does not interfere
        with or alter the other atoms present in the structure.
        ODA-Counter Ion Relationship: Extracting ODA (octadecylamine) will influence
        the count of counter ions, specifically the chloride ions (Cl).
        Sodium-Chloride Balance: Removal of sodium (Na) will have a corresponding impact
        on the number of chloride ions (Cl).
        Nanoparticle Counter Ions: Upon clearing the desired area, ensure that counter ions
        for the nanoparticle are incorporated. Given that the nanoparticle is positively
        charged, chloride ions (most probably) will serve as the counter ions. The number
        of these counterions will be contingent upon the charge of the nanoparticle.
        Salt Concentration: If maintaining a specific salt concentration is critical,
        then make sure to adjust the amount of salt in the system accordingly post
        nanoparticle addition.
